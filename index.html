      <h1>Git Commands</h1>
      <p> Mainly about saving snapshots and checking logs and status of files</p>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>git init</strong> - Used to initialize a Git repository</li>
         <li><strong>git add FileName or git add .</strong> - Add a file or everything to staging</li>
         <li><strong>git commit -m "Message"</strong> - Record changes to the repository with a message</li>
         <li><strong>git status</strong> - Check the status of the working directory and staging area</li>
         <li><strong>git log</strong> - View the commit history of the repository</li>
      </ol>

   <h1>Working with the Branch</h1>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>git checkout "id/name of commit"</strong> - Switches to a specific commit in the repository (detached HEAD), <br/>allows you to move to a certain commit in your current branch</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout branch-name</strong> - Switches to the specified branch</li>
        <li><strong>git switch branch-name</strong> - Modern way to switch to a specified branch</li>
        <li><strong>git branch</strong> - Lists all branches in the repository</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Advance branch commands</h2>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>git branch -d branch-name</strong> - Deletes the specified branch (only if it has been merged)</li>
        <li><strong>git branch -D branch-name</strong> - Force deletes the specified branch (even if it hasn't been merged)</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note"><u>Note regarding git checkout</u></p>
   <p>git checkout is used to switch branches or restore working tree files, but it can also be used to view the state of the repository at a specific commit. When you checkout a commit, you are in a "detached HEAD" state, which means you are not on any branch. This allows you to explore the repository's history without affecting the current branch.</p>
   <p>To return to the latest commit on the current branch, you can use "git checkout branch-name" or "git checkout master/main" (if your main branch is named "master" or "main").</p>

   <!-- How to create branch -->
   <h2>How to create branches</h2>
      <p>There are many ways of making branches; you can make them out of other branches or out of commits.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>git branch "name of branch"</strong> - Creates a new branch with the given name, but keeps you on your current branch</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout -b "name of branch"</strong> - Creates a new branch and switches to it immediately</li>
        <li><strong>git switch -c "name of branch"</strong> - Modern way to create a new branch and switch to it</li>
      </ol>

   <h1>GitHub Basics</h1>
   <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers a range of features for collaboration, version control, and project management. Here are some basic GitHub commands and concepts:</p>
   <ul>
         <li><strong>git clone</strong> - Used to create a local copy of a remote repository on GitHub. It allows you to work on the project locally and sync changes with the remote repository.</li>
         <li><strong>git push</strong> - Used to upload your local commits to a remote repository on GitHub. It allows you to share your changes with others and update the remote repository.</li>
         <li><strong>git pull</strong> - Used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository on GitHub into your local repository. It allows you to stay up-to-date with the latest changes made by others.</li>
         <li><strong>git fork</strong> - A feature on GitHub that allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's repository. It enables you to make changes and propose them back to the original repository through pull requests.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>GitHub also provides a web interface for managing repositories, issues, pull requests, and more. It is widely used for open-source projects, collaboration, and version control in software development.</p>
   
   <h2>GitHub "Pushing" - Local Repository</h2>
   <p>To push your local commits to a remote repository on GitHub, you can use the following command:</p>
   <ol>
         <li><strong>git remote add origin URL</strong> - Adds a remote repository with the name "origin" and the specified URL</li>
         <li><strong>git branch -M main</strong> - Renames the current branch to "main" (if your main branch is named "master", you can skip this step)</li>
         <li><strong>git push -u origin main</strong> - Pushes your local commits to the "main" branch of the remote repository and sets up tracking</li>
         <li><strong>git push</strong> - After the initial push, you can simply use "git push" to push subsequent commits to the remote repository</li>
         <li><strong>git pull origin main</strong></strong> - Fetches and merges changes from the "main" branch of the remote repository into your local repository</li>
         <li><strong>git push origin branch-name</strong> - Pushes the specified branch to the remote repository</li>
      </ol>
